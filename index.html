      <p>In 2011, many of Queen Street’s buildings were owned by Cardiff’s Council according to Wales Online. Now the Land Registry database reveals that 11% of these buildings are owned by other public offices of English Unitary Authorities and metropolitan and non-metropolitan counties.</p>
        <p>The Nottinghamshire County Council owns the most buildings on Queen Street with nine properties, followed by the Staffordshire County Council with four. The County Council of Merseyside, the Mayor and Burgesses of the London Borough of Wandsworth, and the Cheshire West and Chester Borough Council each own one property.
        </p>
        <p>
        Wales Online reported (based on information they received from a Freedom of Information Request) that the Cardiff Council then owned the buildings housing Boots and Marks and Spencer. Currently, according to the Land Registry, both Marks and Spencer and Boots now own their own buildings.
Four large, undeveloped lots behind other properties on Queen Street are owned by The Welsh Ministers.
</p>
<p>
In total, 20 properties are owned by public offices. All of the properties owned by the Welsh Government and local councils and offices are freeholds, which means that they own outright the land and the property on it.

Claire Aherne is the Flagship Store Manager of Queen Street’s Ann Summers, a lingerie boutique on Queen Street. She was unaware that her store’s headquarters paid rent to the County Council of Merseyside.

        “It doesn’t affect me day to day,” Aherne said. “I take care of the lighting the heating, everything else is set up through headquarters.”
        </p>
        <p>
        On finding out this information, she reflected that she is glad her business is supporting what she considers to be a local entity.
        </p>
        <p>
        “We’re part of the heritage of England,” Aherne said.
        </p>
        <p>
        Brad Harvey, a customer service consultant at the Samsung Experience Store, was also surprised to learn that the property of the store was owned by the Mayor and Burgesses of the London County of Wandsworth.
        </p>
        <p>
        But O2’s Assistant Store Manager Jessie Howells was aware that the Chesire West and Chester Borough Council owned the land and building.
        “It’s well-maintained,” Howells said. “I don’t deal with them often because its such a big company.”
        </p>
        <p>
        Many of the other corporations own the buildings they are housed in, especially larger and international businesses. For example, McDonald’s and Santander and own the property they trade on.
        </p>
        <p>
        Some large international chains, however, are supporting local English councils; for example, Pizza Hut is located at 3 Queen Street which is owned by the Staffordshire County Council. One of the Queen Street Starbucks and a KFC are also housed on Nottinghamshire County Council property.
